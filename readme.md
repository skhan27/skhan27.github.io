# Personal Portfolio Site

Built only using mostly HTML and CSS (some JS was necessary to handle events). 
It is responsive depending on the device it is being viewed on. Will be updated as more projects are to be added to the projects section 

A lot of the design is based on the project site used in Jonas Schmedtmann's CSS course. Background video taken from Coverr. 
The email functionality uses formspree.io (handy for static sites like this without a backend).
