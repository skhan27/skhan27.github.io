# Personal Portfolio Site

Built only using mostly HTML and CSS (some JS was necessary to handle events). 
A lot of the design is based on the project site used in Jonas Schmedtmann's CSS course. Background video taken from Coverr. 
The email functionality uses formspree.io (handy for static sites like this without a backend).
